           Recovery Limits in Pointwise Degradation </h4>

         Pointwise image formation models appear in a variety of photography, vision and
image-based rendering problems, such as: lens glare, microscopic fluorescence
mixtures, specular/diffuse reflection, flash faloff, backscatter and
attenuation in media, direct/indirect illumination, and more. An expanding
array of methods has been devised to handle such problems. However, what is the
recovery limit? Are there object features that cannot be effectively recovered
under a pointwise degradation, despite the best efforts made by the recovery
method? If some objects are not recovered, is there a point in trying to
develop a new method to salvage them, or is their loss fundamental? How does
this depend on the object/feature size? We derive bounds to recovery from
pointwise degradations. The bounds apply even if the parameters of a recovery
algorithm are perfectly set. The analysis uses a physical model for the
acquired signal and noise, and also accounts for potential post-acquisition n
oise filtering. The analysis yields an effective cutoff-frequency, which is
induced by noise, despite having no optical blur in the imaging model. We show
the consequence to real applications. <br/>
