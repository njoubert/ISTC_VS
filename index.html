title:MAIN
blurb:The Visual Computing Center engages in open, collaborative, and exploratory research in visual computing.  We seek to bring modern trends in computing (the cloud, crowd sourcing, hand-held computing) to bear on hybrids of computer graphics, animation, image understanding, and large-scale gaming.
